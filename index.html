      <h4>Diet may affect risk and severity of COVID-19</h4>
      <img src="https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dan-cristian-padure-mIyZDPhuyY0-unsplash_2500-1500x1000.jpg"class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >Although metabolic conditions such as obesity and Type 2 diabetes have been linked to an increased risk of COVID-19, as well as an increased risk of experiencing serious symptoms once infected, the impact of diet on these risks is unknown. In a recent study led by researchers at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and published in Gut, people whose diets were based on healthy plant-based foods had lower risks on both counts. The beneficial effects of diet on COVID-19 risk seemed especially relevant in individuals living in areas of high socioeconomic deprivation. 

“Previous reports suggest that poor nutrition is a common feature among groups disproportionately affected by the pandemic, but data on the association between diet and COVID-19 risk and severity are lacking,” says lead author Jordi Merino, a research associate at the Diabetes Unit and Center for Genomic Medicine at MGH and an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School.

For the study, Merino and his colleagues examined data on 592,571 participants of the smartphone-based COVID-19 Symptom Study. Participants lived in the U.K. and the U.S., and they were recruited from March 24, 2020 and followed until Dec. 2, 2020. At the start of the study, participants completed a questionnaire that asked about their dietary habits before the pandemic. Diet quality was assessed using a healthful Plant-Based Diet Score that emphasizes healthy plant foods such as fruits and vegetables. 

During follow-up, 31,831 participants developed COVID-19. Compared with individuals in the lowest quartile of the diet score, those in the highest quartile had a 9 percent lower risk of developing COVID-19 and a 41 percent lower risk of developing severe COVID-19. “These findings were consistent across a range of sensitivity analysis accounting for other healthy behaviors, social determinants of health and community virus transmission rates,” says Merino.

“Although we cannot emphasize enough the importance of getting vaccinated and wearing a mask in crowded indoor settings, our study suggests that individuals can also potentially reduce their risk of getting COVID-19 or having poor outcomes by paying attention to their diet,” says co-senior author Andrew Chan, a gastroenterologist and chief of the Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit at MGH. 

The researchers also found a synergistic relationship between poor diet and increased socioeconomic deprivation with COVID-19 risk that was higher than the sum of the risk associated with each factor alone.

“Our models estimate that nearly a third of COVID-19 cases would have been prevented if one of two exposures — diet or deprivation — were not present,” says Merino.

The results also suggest that public health strategies that improve access to healthy foods and address social determinants of health may help to reduce the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic.  

“Our findings are a call to governments and stakeholders to prioritize healthy diets and wellbeing with impactful policies, otherwise we risk losing decades of economic progress and a substantial increase in health disparities,” says Merino.

     <h4   >Don’t let delta disrupt learning, expert says</h4>
     <img src="https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AP_Mass.Student-1500x1000.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12" >
     <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >With the delta variant surging in the United States just as the school year begins, parents are wondering — and worried — about the threat to children. To address their fears, Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist and director of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, answered questions from journalist Elana Gordon, producer of “The World,” in an online discussion on Tuesday.

Although, as Gordon pointed out, cases are increasing rapidly, data on deaths and hospitalizations show that children continue to be spared the worst of the virus, Lipsitch said. “Compared to adults, children are much lower risk, even with delta, of getting severe disease,” he said. However, as the overall numbers rise, so do the risks. “A sliver of severe cases are in children,” he said, which means a growing number of cases will bring an increase in the number of seriously ill children as well.

Less clear, said Lipsitch, is whether delta itself is a driver of more severe illness. What we do know is that the variant is exponentially more transmissible. This represents a shift from earlier in the year, when the risk of vaccinated people transmitting the virus was considered minimal. To explain the change, Lipsitch cited the combination of delta being more contagious and better able to get through vaccine protection, and the possible waning of vaccine efficacy over time.

In any case, vaccines for children should not be rushed, he said: “The time being spent to ensure that the vaccines are safe and effective in children is well spent.” Although the delay makes it unlikely that children under 12 will be vaccinated this year, “it would be much worse to find that there was a side effect that we haven’t accounted for.

“We need to reach a balance between large-scale closures and not closing down at the first sign,” said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard Chan School. Jon Chase/Harvard file photo
With vaccines months away, Gordon asked Lipsitch how school leaders can safely navigate the threat of classroom exposures. This is a daunting challenge, he responded, given the benefits of in-person schooling. “We need to reach a balance between large-scale closures and not closing down at the first sign.”

The nation’s schools better are prepared than they were last year, he added, citing the roles of masking and improved ventilation in keeping transmission low.

“The value of in-person school is sufficiently great that almost anything we can do within reason to reduce that risk is worth doing,” Lipsitch said. “I would much rather see in-person school with masks than schools being shut down left and right because of transmission.”

Acknowledging that the science is shifting — “maybe the definition of ‘vaccinated’ will change from two doses to three” — Lipsitch said, “As we’ve all observed, public health authorities update their guidance at a dizzying pace until you need to know something, and then it’s too slow.” Such dilemmas are inevitable. “It confuses people to change things, but you have to be responsive to the science,” he said.</p>

          <p class="p_modal">Philip Warren Anderson, a Harvard Alumnus and a Nobel Prize winner in 1970, was a theoretical physicist. He made significant contributions to the theory of Antiferromagnetism, electron localization, high-temperature superconductivity, and symmetry breaking. He also named an offshoot of physics called condensed matter physics. Anderson completed his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1949. Before that, he graduated from the same institute five years ago. Not just a Nobel Laureate, Philip W. Anderson won many awards and honors in his life. Some of the names of his accomplishments include the ‘Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize’, ‘The Golden Plate Award’, and the National Medal of Science’. <br>
